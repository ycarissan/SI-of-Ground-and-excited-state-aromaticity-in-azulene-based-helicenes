SI of Ground and excited state aromaticity in azulene-based helicenes

## ACID map for the ground state of azulene 
The Anisotropy of the Induced Current Density map for the azulene molecule in its ground state is presented in the accompanying movie, which explores the transannular bond from various rotational angles. The map reveals an isosurface at the transannular bond that exhibits characteristics intermediate between sigma and pi bonding, allowing a small electron flux of diatropic current along this bond.
