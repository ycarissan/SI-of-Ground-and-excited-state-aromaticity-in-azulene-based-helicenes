SI of Ground and excited state aromaticity in azulene-based helicenes

## ACID map for the ground state of azulene 
The Anisotropy of the Induced Current Density map for the azulene molecule for all electrons in its ground state is presented in the accompanying movie, which explores the transannular bond from various rotational angles. The map reveals an isosurface at the transannular bond that exhibits characteristics intermediate between sigma and pi bonding, allowing a small electron flux of diatropic current along this bond (see azulene_ACID_Singlet.mov).

## Study of the delocalized wavefunction decomposition in terms of the localized Lewis structures
Kekul√©_Wavefunction_Decomposition, as well as, Kekule_Diradical_Ionic_Wavefunction_Decomposition repositories contains files.com that can be open with HuLis software. Recover all the localized Lewis structure that were used to obtain the trust factor of the delocalized wavefunction.
